Library for using the Spektrum Satellite Receiver with the Arduino.

This should also work with the "Orange" brand satellite receivers as
these are compatible with the Spektrum receivers.

The binding code is based on Sam Kelly's for the ArduPilot Mega
and modified to work work on the Arduino Pro Mini.

The library was based on work by Øystein Schrøder Elvik which I then recoded.

This allows you to both bind and receive with the same arduino.
